Numeric Web API

I tried to make it RESTful, but as I now understand it I've missed the point slightly.
Currently the idea is to put this into /var/www/api/v1. Then when you add something like /some/thing it takes the some/thing, maybe converts it into variables and sends the data to /var/www/api/v1/index.php as a get request.
Then index.php can process the request. The library we're using here (SLIM) allows for GET/PUT/DELETE/POST requests to be sent to index.php (as is in line with REST constraints).

The important stuff is happening from about line 270 in index.php, where the routing is actually taking place.
Before this I've defined some functions which print json in a routine way.

Currently, the calls are:

1.
/caps_id/capsid
where capsid is a variable, representing the topic to pick up in the Numeric database
returns video data for each video in this caps topic

2.
/tree
no variables, prints our our whole database as a tree (grade -> term -> week/caps_topic -> video)

3.
/topics
no variables, prints all caps topics without video information.
This can go but the curriculum tool depends on it.

adding &callback=my_func will pad the JSON with myfunc() so you can load it into your webapp (in our case the curriculum mapping tool).
